Relatively simple Python script to simulate relativistic light aberration and the Doppler Effect. 

It uses an actual star map from the Bright Stars Catalogue. The stars are classified according to their stellar type, from which their temperature is roughly inferred, and then converted into RGB color based on the algorithm by Tanner Helland.

The settings for brightness change and the Doppler shift are set empirically. In reality, you likely wouldn't notice the blue shift against the overall brightness increase.
